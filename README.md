# Pytweets

#Intro:
Pytweets is a mini project of mine, that
prints all the tweets/re-tweets you have
done so far.


#How to install:
I have uploaded this module on the test-server
of the PyPI. Therefore, you can install this package using pip or easy_install.
  1. pip install Pytweets
  2. easy_install Pytweets
  3. If you have downloaded the source, you could just type in command : $ pyhton setup.py install

NOTE : DONT FORGET TO INSTALL THIS PACKAGE USING VIRTUALENV :)


#How to use:
     1. Just import the package: "tweets"
             import tweets
     2. Invoke "mytweets" funciton.
             tweets.mytweets()
             
             
             
#Utilities:
Not much, I just created this package for testing. One could easily go to twitter and see the tweets, but thats too mainstream,  thus a python module, who will do this for you.

Also, you could make this exectable, using chmod command. :)


#How to clone this repo:
    git clone https://github.com/Rahul91/Pytweets.git
 Feel free to play around with code.
