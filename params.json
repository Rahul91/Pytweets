{"name":"Pytweets","tagline":"","body":"# Pytweets\r\n\r\n#Intro:\r\nPytweets is a mini project of mine, that\r\nprints all the tweets/re-tweets you have\r\ndone so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n#How to install:\r\nI have uploaded this module on the test-server\r\nof the PyPI. Therefore, you can install this package using pip or easy_install.\r\n  1. pip install Pytweets\r\n  2. easy_install Pytweets\r\n  3. If you have downloaded the source, you could just type in command : $ pyhton setup.py install\r\n\r\nNOTE : DONT FORGET TO INSTALL THIS PACKAGE USING VIRTUALENV :)\r\n\r\n\r\n#How to use:\r\n     1. Just import the package: \"tweets\"\r\n             import tweets\r\n     2. Invoke \"mytweets\" funciton.\r\n             tweets.mytweets()\r\n             \r\n             \r\n             \r\n#Utilities:\r\nNot much, I just created this package for testing. One could easily go to twitter and see the tweets, but thats too mainstream,  thus a python module, who will do this for you.\r\n\r\nAlso, you could make this exectable, using chmod command. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n#How to clone this repo:\r\n    git clone https://github.com/Rahul91/Pytweets.git\r\n Feel free to play around with code.\r\n               \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
